# FriendFinder05 - Laravel PHP website for Dawson College students

FriendFinder05 is a PHP web application, designed using the Laravel framework, for students at Dawson College. The application consists of several features useful for keeping track of courses, as well as friends' breaks from courses. This site also features several APIs that can be used by developers looking to create extensions or external applications using our information.

* Friend management: FriendFinder05 allows users to keep track of a list of their friends, and search for other users to register as friends.
* Course management: Users can build a list of their current courses based on a database of course information provided by Dawson College.
* Break finder: This feature allows a user to provide a specific time and day of the week, from which the site will search for friends who do not have classes at this time.
* APIs: FriendFinder05 features a number of APIs that can be accessed, given valid user credentials, to provide data that may be useful for those seeking to create addons or external apps for the site. APIs include: finding all friends, finding friends not in class for a given time, finding friends registered for a class, finding a friend's location at a given time.
* User registration and authentication, to ensure data can only be accessed by registered users.
